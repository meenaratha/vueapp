# vueapp (Employee CRUD App)
I would like to express my gratitude for inviting me to the interview. I am extremely interested in joining your esteemed organization and am pleased to inform you that I have completed the second round of the interview process within the given timeframe.

As part of the interview task, I developed an employee CRUD application using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS. I enjoyed learning a great deal throughout the development process.
